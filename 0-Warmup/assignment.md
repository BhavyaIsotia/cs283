## 4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

I want to become more comfortable using Linux and understand the tools and workflows used in systems programming. Since this is my first week, Iâ€™m excited to explore how everything fits together, I hope to gain practical experience that will help me in future classes and internships.


## 5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

I am not concerned but rather just overwelmed by the idea of learning something so fundamental that will be used by me in future classes and practical work in real life!
